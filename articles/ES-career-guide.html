                        An amalgamation of all sciences, social and natural,
                        environmental science is a new, upcoming field with much
                        fewer developments than all the other fields. Concerns
                        sparked from World War 2 and the industrial revolution
                        for the future of our planet have skyrocketed the demand
                        for workers in environmental fields: policy making,
                        habitat preservation, energy conservation, waste
                        management, and sustainable agriculture, the
                        possibilities are infinite.

                        Typically, most ES-oriented careers start with a
                        bachelor’s degree, but you can always experience the
                        field starting in high school. Clubs that focus on any
                        sort of science-oriented competition, social service
                        such as the Rotary Interact club, or even outside
                        organizations such as the Scouts of America can give
                        insight into environmental-oriented service projects or
                        even learn about the processes of our dynamic world. In
                        undergraduate studies at any university, environmental
                        science degrees are not as popular but are usually
                        combined with various other fields to promote
                        interdisciplinary and a holistic perspectives of
                        thinking.
